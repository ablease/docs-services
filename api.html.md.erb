[v2 API Change Log](v2-api-changelog.html)

<%= partial "version_table_generic.html" %>

## <a id='changes'></a>Changes ##

### <a id='change-policy'></a>Change Policy ###

* Existing endpoints and fields will not be removed or renamed.
* New optional endpoints, or new HTTP methods for existing endpoints, may be
added to enable support for new features.
* New fields may be added to existing request/response messages.
These fields must be optional and should be ignored by clients and servers
that do not understand them.

### <a id='api-changes-since-v2-9'></a>Changes Since v2.9 ###

* Backward incompatible changes to experimental `volume_mounts` field in service bind response.

## <a id='overview'></a>API Overview ##

The Service Broker API defines the contract between the services marketplace of a platform and the service broker.

### <a id='def-servicebroker'></a>Definition: Service Broker

The service broker is the component of the service that implements the Service Broker API. Service brokers do the following:

* Advertise a catalog of service offerings and service plans on the services marketplace of a platform 
* Interpret calls for provisioning, binding, unbinding, and deprovisioning

What a broker does with each call can vary between services. In general, "provision" reserves resources on a service and "bind" delivers information to an application necessary for accessing the resource. 

The reserved resource is a service instance. What a service instance represents can vary by service. It can be a single database on a multi-tenant server, a dedicated cluster, or an account on a web application.

### <a id='servicebroker-features'></a>Service Broker Features

A service broker has the following features:

* Implements several HTTP (or HTTPS) endpoints underneath a URI prefix
* Can provide one or more services, with load balancing to enable horizontal scalability of redundant brokers
* Can support multiple platform instances with a single broker using different URL prefixes and credentials

## <a id='api-version-header'></a>API Version Header ##

Requests from the platform to the service broker must contain a header that defines the version number of the Service Broker API that the marketplace will use. Consult the following example of the API version header:

`X-Broker-Api-Version: 2.10`

The version numbers are in the format `MAJOR.MINOR`, using semantic versioning
such that 2.9 comes before 2.10.

This header will be useful in future minor revisions of the API to allow
brokers to reject requests from marketplaces that they do not understand. While minor API revisions will always be additive, it is possible that brokers
will come to depend on a feature that was added after 2.0, so they may use this
header to reject the request.

### <a id='error-message'></a>Service Broker Error Message ##

A service broker should respond with a `412 Precondition Failed` message when rejecting a request.

Error messages from the service broker should inform the operator of the following: 

* The required version number
* The actual version number

## <a id='authentication'></a>Authentication ##

The marketplace must authenticate with the service broker using HTTP
basic authentication with the `Authorization:` header on every request and
reject any broker registrations that do not contain a username and password.
The broker is responsible for checking the username and password and returning
a `401 Unauthorized` message if credentials are invalid.

## <a id='catalog-mgmt'></a>Catalog Management ##

The first endpoint that a broker must implement is the service catalog.
The marketplace initially fetches this endpoint from all brokers and makes
adjustments to the user-facing service catalog stored in the marketplace
database in response to different events.

Consult the following table to understand how different events trigger different actions from the marketplace.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Event</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The catalog fails to initially load or validate.</td>
    <td>The marketplace must not allow the operator to add the new broker and give a meaningful error message.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The broker is updated.</td>
    <td>The marketplace must update the catalog, so that a developer can use <code>update-service-broker</code> with no changes to force a catalog refresh.
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The marketplace fetches a catalog from a broker.</td>
    <td>The marketplace must compare the broker's ID for services and plans with the <code>unique_id</code> values for services and plans in the marketplace database.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A service or plan in the broker catalog has an ID that is not present among the <code>unique_id</code> values in the marketplace database.</td>
    <td>A new record must be added to the marketplace database.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A service or plan in the marketplace database are found with a <code>unique_id</code> that matches the broker catalog's ID.</td>
    <td>The marketplace must update the records to match the broker's catalog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The database has plans that are not found in the broker catalog, and there are no associated service instances.</td>
    <td>The marketplace must remove these plans from the database, and then delete services that do not have associated plans from the database.
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The database has plans that are not found in the broker catalog, but there are provisioned instances.</td>
    <td>The marketplace must mark the plan inactive and no longer display it or allow it to be provisionable.</td>
</table>

The following sections describe catalog requests and responses in the Service Broker API.

#### Body - Schema of Service Objects ####

CLI and web clients have different needs with regard to service and plan names.
A CLI-friendly string is all lowercase, with no spaces.
Keep it short -- imagine a user having to type it as an argument for a longer
command.
A web-friendly display name is camel-cased with spaces and punctuation supported.

### <a id='create-broker'></a>Adding a Broker to the Platform ###

After implementing the first endpoint `GET /v2/catalog` documented (above)[catalog-mgmt], you must register the service broker with your platform to make your services and plans available to end users.

## <a id='synch-asynchronous-operations'></a>Synchronous and Asynchronous Operations ##

The Service Broker API supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations. Brokers must respond to requests with either a synchronous or asynchronous response:

* `201 CREATED`: Users expect a service instance to be provisioned and usable.
* `202 ACCEPTED`: The requested operation has been accepted but is not complete.

Service brokers must respond to all marketplace requests within 60 seconds. Brokers that can guarantee completion of the requested operation with the response should return the synchronous response. Brokers that cannot guarantee completion of the operation with the response should implement support for asynchronous provisioning. Support for synchronous or asynchronous responses may vary by service offering, even by service plan.

###<a id='sync'></a> Synchronous Operations

To execute a request synchronously, the broker need only return the usual status codes: `201 CREATED` for create, and `200 OK` for update and delete.

If the `accepts_incomplete=true` parameter is not included, and the broker cannot fulfill the request synchronously (guaranteeing that the operation is complete on response), then the broker should reject the request with the status code `422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY` and the following body:

<pre class="terminal">
{
  "error": "AsyncRequired",
  "description": "This service plan requires client support for asynchronous service operations."
}
</pre>

###<a id='async'></a> Asynchronous Operations

The `202 ACCEPTED` response triggers the platform to poll a new endpoint `/v2/service_instances/:guid/last_operation` until the broker indicates that the requested operation has succeeded or failed. During the intervening time, end users are able to discover the state of the requested operation using platform API clients.

For an operation to be executed asynchronously, the platform API client, the platform, and service broker must support the feature. The parameter `accepts_incomplete=true` must be passed in a request by the platform API client, triggering the platform to include the same parameter in a request to the broker. The broker can then choose to execute the request synchronously or asynchronously.

If the broker executes the request asynchronously, the response must use the status code `202 ACCEPTED`. The response body should be the same as if the broker were serving the request synchronously.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Asynchronous Operations are currently supported only for provision, update, and deprovision. Bind and unbind will be added once the feature is considered stable.</p>

#### <a id='blocking'></a>Blocking Operations ####

The marketplace must ensure that service brokers do not receive requests for an instance while an asynchronous operation is in progress. For example, if a broker is in the process of provisioning an instance asynchronously, the marketplace must not allow any update, bind, unbind, or deprovision requests to be made through the platform. A user who attempts to perform one of these actions while an operation is already in progress must receive an HTTP 400 response with the error message "Another operation for this service instance is in progress."

#### <a id='polling'></a>Polling Last Operation ####

When a broker returns status code `202 ACCEPTED` for [provision](#provisioning), [update](#updating_service_instance), or [deprovision](#deprovisioning), the platform must begin to poll the `/v2/service_instances/:guid/last_operation` endpoint to obtain the state of the last requested operation. The broker response must contain the field `state` and an optional field `description`.

Valid values for `state` are `in progress`, `succeeded`, and `failed`. The platform must poll the `last_operation` endpoint as long as the broker returns `"state": "in progress"`. Returning `"state": "succeeded"` or `"state": "failed"` will cause the platform to cease polling. The value provided for `description` will be passed through to the platform API client and can be used to provide additional detail for users about the state of the operation.

### Request ###

##### Route #####
`GET /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/last_operation`

##### Parameters #####

The request provides these query string parameters as useful hints for brokers.

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Query-String Field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>service_id</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>ID of the service from the catalog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>plan_id</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>ID of the plan from the catalog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>operation</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>The field optionally returned by the service broker on Provision, Update, Deprovision async responses. Represents any state the service broker responsed with as a URL encoded string.</a>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Although the request query parameters <code>service_id</code> and <code>plan_id</code> are not required, the platform should include them on all <code>last_operation</code> requests it makes to service brokers.</p>

##### cURL #####
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl http://username:password@broker-url/v2/service_instances/:instance_id/last_operation
</pre>

### Response ###

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Status Code</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>200 OK</td>
  <td>The expected response body is below.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>410 GONE</td>
  <td>Appropriate only for asynchronous delete requests. The platform should consider this response a success and remove the resource from its database. The expected response body is <code>{}</code>. Returning this while the platform is polling for create or update operations should be interpreted as an invalid response and the platform should continue polling.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Responses with any other status code should be interpreted as an error or invalid response. The platform should continue polling until the broker returns a valid response or the [maximum polling duration](#max-polling-duration) is reached. Brokers may use the `description` field to expose user-facing error messages about the operation state; for more info see [Broker Errors](api.html#broker-errors).

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For success responses, the following fields are valid.

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Response field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>state*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Valid values are <code>in progress</code>, <code>succeeded</code>, and <code>failed</code>. While <code>"state": "in progress"</code>, the platform should continue polling. A response with <code>"state": "succeeded"</code> or <code>"state": "failed"</code> should cause the platform to cease polling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>description</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Optional field. A user-facing message displayed to the platform API client. Can be used to tell the user details about the status of the operation.</td>
</tr>
</tboby>
</table>

\* Fields with an asterisk are required.

<pre class="terminal">
{
  "state": "in progress",
  "description": "Creating service (10% complete)."
}
</pre>

### <a id='polling-interval'></a> Polling Interval ###
When a broker responds asynchronously to a request from the platform containing the `accepts_incomplete=true` parameter, the platform should poll the broker for the operation state at a configured interval. The platform operator can configure this interval in the BOSH deployment manifest using the property `properties.cc.broker_client_default_async_poll_interval_seconds` (defaults to 60 seconds). The maximum supported polling interval is 86400 seconds (24 hours).

### <a id='max-polling-duration'></a>Maximum Polling Duration ###
When a broker responds asynchronously to a request from the platform containing the `accepts_incomplete=true` parameter, the platform should poll the broker for the operation state until the broker response includes `"state":"succeeded"` or `"state":"failed"`, or until a maximum polling duration is reached. If the max polling duration is reached, the platform should cease polling and the operation state will be considered `failed`. The platform operator can configure this max polling duration in the BOSH deployment manifest using the property `properties.cc.broker_client_max_async_poll_duration_minutes` (defaults to 10080 minutes or 1 week).

## <a id='provisioning'></a>Provisioning ##

When the broker receives a provision request from the platform, it should
synchronously take whatever action is necessary to create a new service
resource for the developer.
The result of provisioning varies by service type, although there are a few
common actions that work for many services.
For a MySQL service, provisioning could result in:

* An empty dedicated `mysqld` process running on its own VM.
* An empty dedicated `mysqld` process running in a lightweight container on a
shared VM.
* An empty dedicated `mysqld` process running on a shared VM.
* An empty dedicated database, on an existing shared running `mysqld`.
* A database with business schema already there.
* A copy of a full database, for example a QA database that is a copy of the
production database.

For non-data services, provisioning could just mean getting an account on an
existing system.

### Request ###

## <a id='updating_service_instance'></a>Updating a Service Instance ##

By implementing this endpoint, service broker authors can enable users to modify two attributes of an existing service instance: the service plan and parameters. By changing the service plan, users can upgrade or downgrade their service instance to other plans. By modifying properties, users can change configuration options that are specific to a service or plan. 

To enable support for the update of the plan, a broker should declare support per service by including `plan_updateable: true` in its [catalog endpoint](#catalog-mgmt). 

If this optional field is not included, the platform should return a meaningful error to users for any plan change request, and should not make an API call to the service broker. 

If this field is included and configured as true, the platform should make API calls to the broker for all plan change requests, and it is up to the broker to validate whether a particular permutation of plan change is supported. 

Not all permutations of plan changes are expected to be supported. For example, a service may support upgrading from plan "shared small" to "shared large" but not to plan "dedicated". If a particular plan change is not supported, the broker should return a meaningful error message in response.

## <a id='binding'></a>Binding ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Not all services must be bindable --- some deliver value just from being provisioned. Brokers that offer services that are bindable should declare them as such using <code>bindable: true</code> in the <a href="#catalog-mgmt">Catalog</a>. Brokers that do not offer any bindable services do not need to implement the endpoint for bind requests.</p>

### <a id='binding-types'></a>Types of Binding ###

#### <a id='binding-credentials'></a>Credentials ####

Credentials are a set of information used by an application or a user to utilize the service instance. If `bindable:true` is declared for a service in the catalog endpoint, users may request generation of credentials either by binding the service instance to an application or by creating a service key. When a service instance is bound to an app, the platform will send the app ID with the request. When a service key is created, the app ID is not included. If the broker supports generation of credentials it should return `credentials` in the response. Credentials should be unique whenever possible, so access can be revoked for one application or user without affecting another. 

#### <a id='binding-syslog-drain'></a>Application Log Streaming ####

In response to a bind request for an application (`app_id` included), a broker may also enable streaming of application logs from the platform to a consuming service instance by returning `syslog_drain_url`. 

#### <a id='binding-route-services'></a>Route Services ####

If a broker has declared `"requires":["route_forwarding"]` for a service in the catalog endpoint, the platform should permit a user to bind a service to a route. 

When bound to a route, the route itself will be sent with the bind request. A route is an address used by clients to reach apps mapped to the route. In response a broker may return a `route_service_url` which the platform will use to proxy any request for the route to the service instance at URL specified by `route_service_url`. A broker may declare `"requires":["route_forwarding"]` but not return `route_service_url`. This enables a broker to dynamically configure a network component already in the request path for the route, requiring no change in the platform router. 

#### <a id='binding-volume-services'></a>Volume Services (Experimental)####

If a broker has declared `"requires":["volume_mount"]` for a service in the catalog endpoint, the platform should permit a user to bind one or more volumes to an application. In response to a bind request a volume service broker should return a set of `volume_mount` instructions that the platform should ensure are mounted into the application's containers.

## <a id='unbinding'></a>Unbinding ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Brokers that do not provide any bindable services do not need to implement the endpoint for unbind requests.</p>

When a broker receives an unbind request from the marketplace, it should
delete any resources it created in bind.
Usually this means that an application immediately cannot access the resource.

### Request ###

##### Route #####
`DELETE /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/service_bindings/:binding_id`

The `:binding_id` in the URL is the identifier of a previously created binding (the same `:binding_id` passed in the bind request). The request has no body, because DELETE requests generally do not have bodies.

##### Parameters #####

The request provides these query string parameters as useful hints for brokers.

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For a success response, the expected response body is `{}`.

## <a id='deprovisioning'></a>Deprovisioning ##

When a broker receives a deprovision request from the marketplace, it should

## <a id='orphans'></a>Orphans ##

The marketplace is the source of truth for service instances and bindings. Service brokers are expected to have successfully provisioned all the instances and bindings that the marketplace knows about, and none that it doesn't.

Orphans can result if the broker does not return a response before a request from the marketplace times out (typically 60 seconds). For example, if a broker does not return a response to a provision request before the marketplace times out, the broker might eventually succeed in provisioning an instance after the marketplace considers the request a failure. This results in an orphan instance on the service side.

To mitigate orphan instances and bindings, the marketplace should attempt to delete resources it cannot be sure were successfully created, and will keep trying to delete them until the broker responds with a success.

More specifically, when a provision or bind request to the broker fails, the marketplace should immediately send a corresponding delete or unbind request. If the delete or unbind request fails, the marketplace will retry the delete or unbind request ten times with an exponential back-off schedule, over a period of 34 hours.

If the marketplace encounters an internal error provisioning an instance or binding (for example, saving to the database fails), then the marketplace should send a single delete or unbind request to the service broker but not retry.
